# 🎉 Go Clubbing

## 💡 Inspiration  
We were inspired by the chaos of club fairs, career fairs, and other campus events — too many QR codes, flyers, and links to keep track of.  
After countless late nights sorting through QR codes and information, we wanted a way to **scan once, store everything neatly, and decide later what’s worth attending.**

## 🚀 What It Does  
📸 Upload scanned or saved QR code images  
🔍 Extract links and event info  
🗓️ Organize events by date and time  
👍👎 Swipe to keep or discard events  
📅 Auto-add events to your calendar  
💼 Provide descriptions for each club  
✨🎉 Nightclub-themed interface for fun  

## 🛠️ How We Built It  
💻 Front-end built entirely in **Streamlit** for simple deployment and a clean web interface  
🎨 Styled using **CSS** to make the UI aesthetic and responsive  
🖼️ Used **Python** for image processing and QR code extraction  
⚡ Designed as a **single-file app** to keep deployment and testing straightforward  

## ⚙️ Challenges We Ran Into  
🧐 Managing client-side rendering to fully extract text from QR images  
⚙️ Testing server-side processing while keeping the UI responsive  
🔄 Maintaining consistency across image parsing, QR decoding, and calendar integration  
⏳ Handling large amounts of data with limited time — we even had another feature ready but couldn’t implement it due to the time crunch!  

## 🏆 Accomplishments We’re Proud Of  
✅ Completing our first full hackathon project  
🌐 Building a pipeline that processes images and integrates events with multiple calendar platforms  
👌 Creating an intuitive keep/discard interface for smooth user interaction  
🎉 Enabling **JavaScript AI and Python** to communicate via a tertiary server  
🖥️ Utilizing a **virtual machine** to assist with web deployment  

## 📚 What We Learned  
🚀 Rapid web app deployment using **Streamlit**  
🖼️ Image processing and **QR code extraction**  
⏱️ Parsing dates and times from unstructured QR text  
📅 Integrating with **.ics calendar formats** for real-world usability  
🔑 Managing **API keys** to connect services securely  
🧪 Running targeted tests to debug efficiently  

## 🔮 What’s Next for Go Clubbing  
We plan to **expand and enhance** Go Clubbing to reach more users and features:  

🏫 Integrate with more schools (we started with Georgia Tech resources)  
💼 Extend to **career fairs and professional events**  
📱 Build a **mobile app** for better cross-device usability  
✨ Add **smart recommendations** that match a user’s resume and interests with clubs and events — the algorithm is already implemented but not yet deployed!
